Given a dataset of Co2 emission of different cars, with fields like Engine size, Cylinders, Fuel Consumption
and Co2 emissions for various car models, Can we predict the Co2 emission of a car, using another field, such as Engine size?

Yes! We can use linear regression to predict a continuous value such as Co2 Emission, by using other variables like Engine size, Cylinders, Fuel Consumption etc.

# What is Linear Regression?
It's a process of predicting continuous values using other variables.

We can use regression methods to predict a continuous value (y), such as CO2 Emission, using some other variables (x or x1, x2, x3...)

In regression there are two types of variables: 
- a dependent variable (y) and 
- one or more independent variables (x)

`y` is the "target" or "final goal" that we study and try to predict and `x` is/are the "causes" of the target.

## When should you use Linear Regression?
Use Linear Regression when:

- You need to predict a continuous value
- You have a clear dependent variable and one or more independent variables
- Your dependent variable shows a linear relationship with independent variables.


> :warning: **IMPORTANT:** 
The key point in the regression is that our dependent value should be continuous, and cannot be a discreet value. However, the independent variable or variables can be measured on either a categorical or
continuous measurement scale.

There are 2 types of regression models: 
1. Simple regression and 
2. Multiple regression.


## Simple Linear Regression
Simple regression is when one x or independent variable is used to estimate a dependent variable y. It can be either linear on non-linear.

For example, predicting Co2emission using the variable of EngineSize.

**Formula**:
$$
\hat{y} = \theta_0 + \theta_1 x_1
$$

Where:
- $\hat{y}$ is the predicted value (dependent variable)
- $\theta_0$ is the y-intercept (bias term)
- $\theta_1$ is the slope coefficient
- $x_1$ is the independent variable


## Multiple Linear Regression
When more than one x or independent variable is present, the process is called multiple linear regression. It also can be either linear on non-linear.

For example, predicting Co2emission using EngineSize and the number of Cylinders or more causes in any given car. 

**Formula**:
$$
\hat{y} = \theta_0 + \theta_1 x_1 + \theta_2 x_2 + \dots + \theta_n x_n
$$

$$
\hat{y} = \theta_0 + \sum_{i=1}^{n} \theta_ix_i
$$

Where:
- $\hat{y}$ is the predicted value
- $\theta_0$ is the y-intercept (bias term)
- $\theta_i$ are the coefficients
- $x_i$ are the independent variables
- $n$ is the total number of independent variables
