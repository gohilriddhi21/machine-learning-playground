# Predicting CO2 Emissions with Linear Regression

This project explores the use of linear regression to predict CO2 emissions from vehicles based on factors such as engine size, number of cylinders, and fuel consumption. Linear regression is a statistical method used for modeling relationships between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

## What is Linear Regression?

Linear regression predicts continuous values (e.g., CO2 emissions) using one or more independent variables (e.g., engine size, number of cylinders). It identifies a relationship where:

- **Dependent variable (y)**: The target or outcome to predict.
- **Independent variable(s) (x)**: The predictors or causes of the target variable.

### When to Use Linear Regression

Linear regression is suitable when:

- You need to predict a continuous value.
- There is a clear dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
- The dependent variable shows a linear relationship with the independent variables.

> :warning: **IMPORTANT:**
> The dependent variable must be continuous. Independent variables can be either categorical or continuous.

## Types of Regression Models

### 1. Simple Linear Regression

Simple regression uses a single independent variable to predict a dependent variable.

#### Example:
Predicting CO2 emissions using engine size.

#### Formula:
$$
\hat{y} = \theta_0 + \theta_1 x_1
$$

Where:
- \( \hat{y} \): Predicted value (dependent variable)
- \( \theta_0 \): Intercept (bias term)
- \( \theta_1 \): Coefficient for the independent variable
- \( x_1 \): Independent variable

---

### 2. Multiple Linear Regression

Multiple regression uses more than one independent variable to predict a dependent variable.

#### Example:
Predicting CO2 emissions using engine size, number of cylinders, and fuel consumption.

#### Formula:
$$
\hat{y} = \theta_0 + \theta_1 x_1 + \theta_2 x_2 + \dots + \theta_n x_n
$$

Or equivalently:
$$
\hat{y} = \theta_0 + \sum_{i=1}^{n} \theta_i x_i
$$

Where:
- \( \hat{y} \): Predicted value
- \( \theta_0 \): Intercept (bias term)
- \( \theta_i \): Coefficients for independent variables
- \( x_i \): Independent variables
- \( n \): Total number of independent variables

## Applications of Linear Regression

Linear regression is widely used in various domains, including:

- **Sales forecasting**: Predicting sales based on salespersonâ€™s age, education, experience.
- **Real estate**: Predicting house prices using size, location, and number of bedrooms.
- **Income prediction**: Estimating income based on work hours, education, experience.
- **Customer satisfaction**: Analyzing satisfaction based on demographic factors.
- **Healthcare**: Predicting health metrics based on lifestyle factors.
- **Finance**: Forecasting trends and analyzing financial data.
